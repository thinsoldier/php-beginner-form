Instructions:

Make a new gmail account just for sending mail.

Log into the account and go to https://myaccount.google.com/security

Scroll down to "Allow less secure apps" and turn that on.

Duplicate config.php.example as config.php

Use the e-mail address and password for that account in your config.php

Do not commit your config.php

Install Composer dependencies.

You can try it with `php -S localhost:9000 contact.php` if you don't have a web server, but the css won't load.
